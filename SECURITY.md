## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Use GitHub's Security Advisory feature** to privately report the vulnerability

3. Include as much detail as possible in your report

**Response timeline:**

- We will acknowledge your report within 1-2 weeks
- We will provide a detailed response as soon as possible (this is a side project with limited maintenance time)
- We will work on fixes when time permits and keep you updated on progress
- We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

**What to expect:**

- If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and release a security update
- If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide a detailed explanation
- We will give appropriate credit to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
