## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Package Manager Detection

The system SHALL detect the package manager used in the project via lock files and runtime environment.

#### Scenario: npm detection

- **WHEN** `package-lock.json` exists
- **THEN** the system identifies npm as the package manager

#### Scenario: yarn detection

- **WHEN** `yarn.lock` exists
- **THEN** the system identifies yarn as the package manager

#### Scenario: pnpm detection

- **WHEN** `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists
- **THEN** the system identifies pnpm as the package manager

#### Scenario: bun detection via lock file

- **WHEN** `bun.lockb` exists
- **THEN** the system identifies bun as the package manager

#### Scenario: bun detection via environment

- **WHEN** BUN environment variable is set or Bun runtime is detected
- **THEN** the system identifies bun as the package manager

#### Scenario: Fallback to npm

- **WHEN** no lock files are present and no runtime is detected
- **THEN** the system defaults to npm as the package manager

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bun Runtime Detection

The system SHALL detect Bun runtime environment and adjust execution accordingly.

#### Scenario: Bun environment variable

- **WHEN** BUN environment variable is set
- **THEN** the system recognizes Bun runtime and adjusts paths

#### Scenario: Bun global detection

- **WHEN** Bun.version global object exists
- **THEN** the system confirms Bun runtime environment

#### Scenario: Bun executable paths

- **WHEN** using Bun package manager
- **THEN** the system resolves TypeScript compiler from Bun's node_modules structure

### Requirement: Cross-Platform Bun Support

The system SHALL execute TypeScript compiler correctly in Bun environments across platforms.

#### Scenario: Bun on Windows

- **WHEN** running on Windows platform with Bun
- **THEN** the system determines correct shell mode and executable extensions

#### Scenario: Bun on Unix

- **WHEN** running on Unix-like platforms with Bun
- **THEN** the system uses direct process execution with Bun-compatible paths

#### Scenario: Bun workspace compatibility

- **WHEN** using Bun in monorepo workspace
- **THEN** the system handles workspace-specific node_modules paths
