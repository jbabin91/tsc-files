# Security Requirements

This document outlines the comprehensive security requirements for the tsc-files TypeScript CLI tool, ensuring safe operation in all environments.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of security validation
- Fail-secure by default
- Principle of least privilege

### Input Validation

- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- No direct shell injection of user-provided data
- Path traversal prevention

## Critical Security Validations

### Temporary File Security

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Temp files use cryptographically random names (crypto.randomBytes)
- [ ] File permissions are restrictive (600 - owner read/write only)
- [ ] Temp files created in secure system temp directory
- [ ] All temp files cleaned up on exit (success or failure)
- [ ] Temp file cleanup on process signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';
import { chmod } from 'fs/promises';

const tempFileName = `tsc-files-${randomBytes(16).toString('hex')}.json`;
await chmod(tempFilePath, 0o600);
```

### Command Execution Security

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Command execution uses execFile with array arguments (not shell)
- [ ] No user input passed directly to shell commands
- [ ] Command arguments are validated against allow-lists
- [ ] TypeScript compiler path is validated before execution
- [ ] Environment variables are sanitized

**Implementation:**

```typescript
import { execFile } from 'child_process';

// SECURE: Array arguments, no shell
execFile('tsc', ['--noEmit', '--project', validatedTsconfigPath]);

// INSECURE: String concatenation with shell
exec(`tsc --project ${userInput}`); // NEVER DO THIS
```

### Path Security

**Requirements:**

- [ ] All file paths are resolved and validated
- [ ] Path traversal attacks prevented (../, ../../, etc.)
- [ ] Symbolic link validation
- [ ] Working directory boundaries enforced

**Implementation:**

```typescript
import { resolve, relative } from 'path';

function validatePath(userPath: string, allowedDir: string): string {
  const resolved = resolve(userPath);
  const relativePath = relative(allowedDir, resolved);

  if (relativePath.startsWith('..')) {
    throw new Error('Path traversal not allowed');
  }

  return resolved;
}
```

## Security Validation Protocols

### Pre-Implementation Security Review

Before implementing any component:

1. **Threat Modeling**:
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Assess impact and likelihood
   - Design countermeasures

2. **Input Surface Analysis**:
   - Map all user inputs
   - Define validation rules
   - Plan sanitization strategies

3. **Privilege Analysis**:
   - Determine minimum required permissions
   - Plan privilege dropping if needed
   - Validate file access patterns

### Security Testing Requirements

**Static Analysis:**

- [ ] ESLint security rules enabled
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enforced
- [ ] No `any` types in security-critical code
- [ ] Regular dependency vulnerability scans

**Dynamic Testing:**

- [ ] Path traversal attack tests
- [ ] Command injection attempt tests
- [ ] Temp file race condition tests
- [ ] Signal handling cleanup tests

**Penetration Testing:**

- [ ] Manual security testing with malicious inputs
- [ ] Fuzzing with random/malformed data
- [ ] Integration testing in hostile environments

## Error Handling Security

### Information Disclosure Prevention

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive paths
- [ ] Stack traces filtered in production
- [ ] Temp file paths not logged
- [ ] User data not included in error outputs

**Implementation:**

```typescript
function sanitizeError(error: Error, context: string): string {
  // Filter out sensitive information
  const message = error.message
    .replace(/\/tmp\/tsc-files-[a-f0-9]+/g, '<temp-file>')
    .replace(/\/Users\/[^/]+/g, '<user-home>');

  return `${context}: ${message}`;
}
```

## Dependency Security

### Package Management

- [ ] All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- [ ] Regular security audits with `pnpm audit`
- [ ] Automated dependency updates with security focus
- [ ] Minimal dependency surface area

### Supply Chain Security

- [ ] Package integrity verification
- [ ] Trusted package sources only
- [ ] Lock file integrity checks
- [ ] Build reproducibility

## Deployment Security

### Distribution

- [ ] Code signing for releases
- [ ] Checksum verification
- [ ] Secure distribution channels
- [ ] Version authenticity

### Runtime Environment

- [ ] Minimal runtime permissions
- [ ] Secure defaults for all options
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Process isolation where possible

## Security Incident Response

### Detection

- [ ] Automated security monitoring
- [ ] Error pattern analysis
- [ ] Performance anomaly detection
- [ ] User report triage

### Response

- [ ] Security issue disclosure policy
- [ ] Patch development and testing
- [ ] Coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- [ ] Post-incident analysis and improvement

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

- [ ] No sensitive data collection
- [ ] Minimal telemetry if any
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] User privacy protection

### Enterprise Requirements

- [ ] Security policy compliance
- [ ] Audit trail capabilities
- [ ] Access control integration
- [ ] Regulatory compliance support

This security framework ensures that tsc-files operates safely in all environments while maintaining usability and performance.
