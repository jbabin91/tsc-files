# Advanced Configuration Handling Proposal

## Why

Current tsconfig.json handling works for standard cases but lacks robustness for complex scenarios:

- Extends chain resolution is basic and may miss edge cases
- Malformed configuration errors lack actionable guidance
- Complex monorepo setups with nested extends chains can fail silently
- Path mapping validation is minimal
- Configuration caching could cause stale config issues

This creates reliability issues in enterprise monorepos and complex TypeScript projects.

## What Changes

- Enhance extends chain resolution with circular reference detection
- Add comprehensive tsconfig.json validation with specific error messages
- Improve path mapping (baseUrl, paths) handling and validation
- Add configuration caching with smart invalidation on file changes
- Provide detailed diagnostics for configuration issues
- Add `--show-config` flag to display resolved configuration

## Impact

- Affected specs: `configuration-management`
- Affected code: `src/config/discovery.ts`, `src/config/parser.ts`, `src/config/validator.ts` (new)
- Breaking changes: None (internal enhancement only)
- Reliability: Significantly improved handling of complex TypeScript configurations
